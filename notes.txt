Hi Praveen,

 

Iâ€™m Shrikant, a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, and I recently came across the Software Engineer role at Aurora's Perception Team. 

 

 I am specializing in 3D object detection and Tensor RT deployment and would love to contribute to Aurora's software stack. Aurora's autonomous vehicle development and its deployment on trucks is something I find fascinating.

 

I am messaging you to know more about this role, and how I as an engineer should be contributing to your team. As a team lead, your insights would be highly valuable in understanding this role and my place better.

 

Best

Shrikant 

 

PS: I am attaching my resume for your reference
