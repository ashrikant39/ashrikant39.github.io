I have completed my masters degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, specializing in Signal and Image Processing and Machine Learning. I am passionate about exploring various generative algorithms for computational imaging problems, predominantly using **Diffusion Models**. I am currently working under Prof. Hun-Seok Kim, where I am developing a generalized framework using **MMDetection3D** for **LiDAR super-resolution** using Diffusion Models. Currently open to work on cutting edge technology involving computer vision and deep learning.

**Advisor**: Prof. [Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/)
