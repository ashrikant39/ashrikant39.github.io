I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, focusing on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 

I am passionate about **3D Object Detection**, **Lidar Perception** and **Generative Modeling** for efficient AI. I am currently working under Prof. Hun-Seok Kim, where I am developing a generalized framework using **MMDetection3D** for **LiDAR super-resolution** using Diffusion Models. Currently open to work on cutting edge technology involving computer vision and deep learning.

**Advisor**: Prof. [Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/)
