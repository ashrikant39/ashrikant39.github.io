**Machine Learning Intern**, *Skylark Labs, New York, USA* <span class="pull-right">June 2023 - Aug 2023</span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-tools" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pytorch, Ultralytics</span>  
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Designed a framework using a pre-trained RegNet model to achieve a recall of 65% in self-learning new categories by storing multi-scale quantized features to recognize pre-trained classes.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Trained a vector-quantized feature extractor to learn efficient multi-scale features of objects in natural scenes, enhancing the accuracy of the model by 12% to detect objects from
        newly learned classes.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Implemented the system to work on a single core of a CPU to run at about 3 fps while storing features of new classes encountered.

**Computer Vision Intern**, *Sixsense, Singapore* <span class="pull-right">Jan 2022 - April 2022</span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-tools" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pytorch, FastAutoAugment, fastai</span>  
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Worked on detecting and classifying defects in semiconductor chips using Faster RCNN.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Trained a stochastic automatic augmentation framework based on Fast AutoAugment on a ResNet50 model to techniques for several public datasets like CIFAR-100 and in-house datasets which improved the average accuracy by 2.3%. Integrated the automatic augmentation  to the defect detection pipeline, improving the accuracy by 1.4%.
