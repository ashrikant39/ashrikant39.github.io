**[Kim's Lab](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/)**, *University of Michigan* <span class="pull-right">May 2023 – Present</span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dr. Hun-Seok Kim, Assistant Professor, EECS</span> 
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Currently working on optimizing a LiDAR point cloud-based 3D object detection pipeline using Latent Diffusion Models.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Trained a diffusion model on the BEV feature-space to compensate data-loss during LiDAR scanning.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Proposed and implemented improvements to the diffusion sampling algorithms for inverse imaging problems, enhancing the quality and fidelity of the samples of latent diffusion models, achieving an FID score of 37.2, an improvement of 17.2% over the baseline model.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Applied latent diffusion models to simulate a source and channel decoding system using diffusion denoising, resulting in a reconstruction PSNR of 24.4 dB using DDIM sampling on a channel SNR of 0 dB.

**[Burris' Lab](https://burris.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)**, *University of Michigan* <span class="pull-right">Aug 2022 – Apr 2023</span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dr. Nicholas Burris, Associate Professor, Radiology</span>  
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Trained an attention-UNET-based model for aortic segmentation, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the Vascular Deformation Mapping pipeline, resulting in an improvement of 3% in the F1-score, particularly around aortic walls.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Implemented corrections to an Elastix-based CT Registration Pipeline, improving the elastic registration performance of the pipeline for large deformations in the aortic walls. The corrections resulted in the detection of tissue growth by an improved recall of 8%.


**[PLRI Lab](https://plri.de/)**, *Technische Universit ̈at Braunschweig* <span class="pull-right">May 2021 – Oct 2021</span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dr. Thomas Deserno, Full Professor, Medical Informatics</span>  
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Developed an efficient codebase for training and testing for semantic segmentation of sclera regions in the eye images.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Acquired partial annotations using a game where the partial masks are saved as players competed for scoring regions.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Acquired an F1 score of 0.94 on the test segmentation set using multiple partial annotations.


**[Dr. Shyam's Lab](https://ece.nitk.ac.in/faculty/shyam-lal)**, *National Institute of Technology Karnataka* <span class="pull-right">Sept 2021 – Dec 2021</span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dr. Shyam Lal, Associate Professor, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering</span>  
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i> Proposed an efficient neural network architecture (LiverNet 2.0) for Cancer Grade Classification models for liver histopathological images, improving the F1 score by 12% from the baseline.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Implemented an efficient training pipeline and hyperparameter tuning to train the model in just 40 epochs to achieve SOTA performance.
<br><i class="fas fa-plus small-grey"></i>Worked closely with the research staff at Kasturba Medical College, India, gathering relevant information about the H&E stained images.
